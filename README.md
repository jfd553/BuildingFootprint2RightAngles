# OrthogonalizingBuildingFootprint
Algorithms and documentation of an application to orthogonalize building footprints.
Aims at improving current applications that tries to orthogonalize building footprints in the OSM community.

OrthogonalizingBuildingFootprint.fmw is an FME workbench created to orthogonalize building footprints. It is a text file interpreted by FME software. The software requires a licence to run it. The workbench can be downloaded and used with an appropriate FME licence.

OrthogonalizingBuildingFootprint.pdf details both the concepts behind orthogonalizing building footprint and the algorithms used in the FME workbench. Since FME is not an open software, the aim of documenting the algorithms used is to enable courageous developers to convert the whole process into open code.

OrthogonalizingBuildingFootprint.osm is a small benchmark dataset, in Osm format, that was used to build/debug the workbench. The documentation refers to that file do describe each step of the process.
