# OrthogonalizingBuildingFootprint
Algorithms and documentation of an application to orthogonalize building footprints.

OrthogonalizingBuildingFootprint.fmw is an FME workbench created to orthogonalize building footprints. An FME workbench is a text file that is interpreted by FME. A licence is required to run the software. The workbench can be downloaded and run by those having an appropriate FME licence.

OrthogonalizingBuildingFootprint.pdf details both the concepts behind orthogonalizing building footprints and the algorithms used in the FME workbench. Since FME is not an open software, the aim of documenting the algorithms is to enable courageous developers to convert the whole process into open code.

OrthogonalizingBuildingFootprint.osm is a small benchmark dataset that was used to build/debug the workbench. Each step of the orthogonalization process is described using this file (pdf documentation).
